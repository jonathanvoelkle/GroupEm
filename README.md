# GroupEm

ðŸ™‹ Grouping people so everyone is happy.

If you've ever had to group people together (esp. kids) and everyone wanted something different, you know it's a pain. This small programm tries to remove the hassle doing that.

<!-- TODO -->

## Installation and Usage

This project is build in python 3.6, so make sure you have python 3 installed (at least nobody has tried running this in python 2.x)

Then just clone this repo and run the programm

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jonathanvoelkle/GroupEm.git
cd groupem
python3 groupem
```

You might have to change the input file (optional, see the following).

If you want to output the assigned groups to a file, you can also run.

```shell
python3 groupem > f.txt
```

to save them to a file called `f.txt`.

The programm tries to locate a file `data/data.csv` (with has to have the said structure).

A sample dataset is provided under [`sample/data.csv`](/sample/data.csv).

Note that a set of data with a large number people or large group-variability can take a (very, very) long time to process, you might have to modify this algorithm.

The code assumes you use a integer based rating system (e.g. stars, higher value means higher preferences) (and transforms them into a cost function to be used in `linear_sum_assignment()`).
